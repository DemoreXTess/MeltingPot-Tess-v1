## Introduction

Tess-v1 is a reinforcement learning solution tailored for the challenges posed in the NeurIPS Melting Pot Contest. The repository encompasses various training and model files, with particular emphasis on `models/model_v4_cont.py`, which is employed in all the final experiments.

## Trainings

- **Harvest**: Trained using `train_multitask_harvest.py`
- **Clean Up**: Trained using `train_multitask.py`
- **Prisoners**: Trained using `train_multitask.py`
- **Territory Rooms**: Trained using `train-v6.py`

Note: For reproducibility, it is essential to configure the parameters in `configs.py`. The necessary configuration details will be shared in the next commit.

## Prerequisites

Before running Tess-v1, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (version >= 2.0.1)
- [Stable-Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3)
- Gym (version 0.21.0)
- OpenCV-Python
- NumPy
- WandB (Weights & Biases)
- MeltingPot Suite

You can install these dependencies using the following:

```bash
pip install torch>=2.0.1 stable-baselines3 gym==0.21.0 opencv-python numpy wandb dm-meltingpot
```
